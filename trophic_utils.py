"""Utility functions to compute trophic levels consistently across the project.

A firm's trophic level is defined as:
    1 + weighted average of the trophic levels of its direct suppliers
where weights correspond to the monetary value of inputs provided by each
supplier.  Firms that require only labour (i.e. have no material suppliers)
have trophic level 1.

The algorithm is implemented as an iterative relaxation that converges even if
cycles are present.  If the supply network is acyclic (the typical case) the
iteration converges in one pass because suppliers are processed before buyers.

Usage example
-------------
>>> adj = {1: [], 2: [1], 3: [1, 2]}
>>> levels = compute_trophic_levels(adj)
>>> levels[1]
1.0
>>> levels[3]
1 + (1*1 + 1*2)/2 = 2.5
