# TODOs

## bugs
- [x] fix production function such that input requirements are informed by network topology 

## immediate 
- [ ] Update network topology so firms can also buy form other firms. 
- [ ] Figure out why firms aren't getting money from selling to households (household wealth keeps going up and firm wealth keeps going down due to labor transaction, but no effect from sales of goods.)

## longer-term / tentative
- [ ] Create fixed-cost "overheads" that firms have to pay to other firms and households (umbrella term for insurance, maintenance, leases, financing, etc. that don't scale up and down with production volume)
- [ ] Use output of damage functions to proportionally affect productivity and overhead of firms 
- [ ] Add bankrupcy when firms can't pay their fixed costs. Update network topology when new firms pop up.
- [ ] Add damage threshold for households, above which they migrate
- [ ] Add support for netCDF input files
- [ ] Add support for more hazards including wildfires, tropical cyclons, drought
- [ ] Add support for chronic risks
